## Course Description

Big data heralds the arrival of a new knowledge backed statistical learning economy. Businesses, research organizations, and universities all exchange and catalog information using distributed cloud filesystems. Taylor will provide each of the students with an orientation into the design, implementation, and operational aspects of high volume durable computer file based storage technologies.

Keywords: Linux, Unix, Networking, Cloud, Virtualization, Encryption, Privacy, and Ethics.

Topics of study will include:
File Input Output
Filesystems
Pipes and Processes
Demonstration Projects
Mr. Taylor Brockman, Summer Ventures (1997) and NCSSM (1999) alum, Chief Technology Officer: Magic Number and Brain Power Software




## Monday Agenda

Goal: Context and Provisioning

Backgrounds

### Types of Computers

Legacy, Modern, Gaming, Laptop, Smartphone, Embedded, Cloud

Original, in ROM chip storage

	Demo: Raspberry Pi setup?

	Activity: Review capabilities of the workstations we have in the lab

### Types of Media

Tape, Floppy disk, Spinning Magnetic, Solid State, Hybrid, Flash, SD, USB, RAID Caching, RAID controllers, Distributed, Replicated, Cloud Block Api

	Demo: How does a magnetic hard drive work? Youtubes?

	Activity: RAID Level Calculations

### Types of Filesystems

FAT, FAT32, NTFS, Joilet, ext2, ext4, xfs, nfs

	Demo: ISO's, DD to SD cards.

	Demo: Fdisk, blocks, inodes.

### Provisioning Access

	Demo: ESXi vm setup with remote access

	Demo: Amazon EC2 , Magic Number

	Activity: Password generation and access testing

### Linux Tools

ssh, bash, secure ftp, mkdir, cat, >>, less, vi, curl, hexdump -c, ln, df, mount, curl, rsync

### Project Research

Taylor's project need of lsyncd and encryption replication.

	Demo: Set up of the issue,  atop performance monitoring.


### Goal of Day 0

At the end of Day 0, every student should have the context of filesystems,  remote access to the svsm2019 student virutal machine, and be empowered to come up with a proposal for a project that includes a filesystem in some way:

visualization, art, gaming, networking, machine learning, performance.
